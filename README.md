## 👋 Welcome to my GitHub profile.

##Update

🌟I apologize for not being as active as I was my laptop broke and I lost my job and than 6 weeks later my car broke down. and every way I had to generate income and support myself was gone. I'm currently living in a shell of a house with no running water or electricity and it's making everything very very difficult. Oh and than on top of all that my mom is terminal with cancer she recently started hospice and thinks she's only got a couple weeks left. Atleast I got my car to a mechanic today, I've been calling a local homeless shelter every day to no avail but once my cars fixed I won't be stuck in this town. I can finally reunite with my mom for her final days. my dad died when I was 8 years old and this is one of my deepest and most profound fears. If anyone has the means to show some support I would be eternally grateful. My cash app tag is $MrBurns59. Worse comes to worse I'm waiting on a couple hundred bucks from taxes and I'll use that for a bare minimum laptop. thank you for making me feel welcome and giving my life some meaning. God bless!
